## Project Overview

This project is a **Database Management System (DBMS)** for a growing boutique chain that sells a variety of dresses across multiple branches. The system is designed to manage all core entities involved in the business, including branches, staff, customers, products, and orders. It supports both in-store and online purchases, ensuring smooth data handling and consistency.

## Repository Structure

```bash
repository/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Boutique SQL.txt       # SQL scripts: schema creation and sample queries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Final_Report.pdf       # Full documentation: ER Diagram, Schema Design, Visual Basic UI

```

## System Description
### 1. Branch Management
